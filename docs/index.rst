Project Concord is an open source scalable decentralized Blockchain. It 
leverages the `Concord-BFT <https://github.com/vmware/concord-bft>`_ engine
based on years of academic and industrial research, and implements 
a Blockchain which supports running Ethereum smart contracts.

This documentation is written for different types of users. IT administrators
who wish to deploy Concord will want to read the :doc:`installation and deployment <deployment>` section.
Blockchain developers who want to build and add new smart contracts will want to read the :doc:`tutorials <tutorials>`,
and developers who want to add new functionality, such as adding support for new APIs or state machines will
want to read the :doc:`developer <developer>` section. For all users new to Concord, we recommend
starting with the :doc:`getting started<getting-started>` section.
